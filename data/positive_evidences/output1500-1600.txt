whereas most commonly used techniques [ e.g. , hydrogen manometry , thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) , secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) ] can measure only total water ( h2ot ) contents , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) is capable of measuring both total water and water species concentrations .

they demonstrate that these coefficients can be used to determine an accurate species - dependent ε3500 value , according to : ε3500 = xohε3500oh + xh2omε3500h2om ( 2 ) where xoh and xh2om are the simple mass fractions of water dissolved as oh or h2om , respectively .

secondary hydration has been shown to be a widespread phenomenon ( e.g. , giachetti and gonnermann 2013 ) , and we recommend the use of ftir analyses to identify ( by their excess h2om contents ) glasses that have been hydrated ; information that can not be obtained by sims or raman spectroscopy .
