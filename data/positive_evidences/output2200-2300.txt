the house overlooks grounds dropping to the southwest with views over the fish pond reservoir , and cyfarthfa ironworks on the far side of the river taff initially , the surrounding parkland was romantic and informal , but by the late 19th century a more formal layout as a landscape park had developed .

certainly , by the later 18th century , when ironstone extraction came to be undertaken on a larger scale for the furnaces of dowlais , cyfarthfa , penydarren and plymouth , the locations of the most accessible portions of the outcropping seams must have been fairly well established , and represented in the landscape by bands of early workings .
